## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Jarema, your local boy on the internet who just so happens to be able to read code.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my website.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning webdev.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything, just [shoot me a message](https://jarema.me/contact).
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with webdev
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, just don't be too personal.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [check my website](https://jarema.me/contact).
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never spoke a word until the age of 3. Parents were horrified the first time I spoke, since apparently I "spoke too fluently for a 3-year-old."
